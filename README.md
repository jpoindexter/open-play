# Open Play

## Current core delivery — 27 October2026

Private **0.1.61 native startup and paused 59→61 recovery are observed**. BX3’s temporary title is restored, its exact124.98471158160582BPM and other metadata retained. Recording preflight was clear;59 quit normally and the closed profile backup matches before/after/copy manifests. All four tracks recovered at2/3/4/5s with16library tracks, controls/previews and zero playback. [Executed evidence and limits](docs/prototype/CORE_NATIVE_061_RECOVERY_2026-10-27.md). No current locked-Mac blocker remains.

Current source refines the deck’s full-track overview using measured REA/native reference wells:44logicalpx for2decks/4V;32px for4H, replacing Compact’s28px. Caption provenance remains accessible without covering the waveform. Canonical component tokens own sizing; deck rows budget the added height. Core controls, seek and library previews remain. [Sizing evidence](docs/prototype/OVERVIEW_SIZING_2026-10-27.md).

Next: deliver the sizing slice and continue only changed native metadata/Tap/reanalysis paths. Capture the next actual pop/stall; no repeated clean soaks. Prior53manual listening retains its version scope. Fresh listening, changed native held gestures, same-version restart, hardware and public-release gates remain open. [Beta scope](docs/delivery/PUBLIC_BETA_PLAN.md).

Independent open-source desktop DJ project, with a browser review candidate and ongoing reference investigation. The goal is familiar Serato DJ Pro design and behavior without artificial feature, account or device gates in the independent implementation.

## Historical implementation evidence

**Prior source candidates — core reliability:** Desktop0.1.56/source3667d6f saves Prepare/manual History edits in a focused39-line session-panels module. Actual native insertion and Prepare add survived quit/process exit/reopen; original96history entries retained plus inserted97,16tracks/previews/controls present,0playing. [Evidence and limits](docs/prototype/desktop-0.1.56-session-panels.json). New session archive/read/export passes isolated handler/storage checks; native archive interaction remains open. Prior53listening/focus,54fader resets and55play-count evidence retain scope. Hardware deferred; software continues. Rare Sync pops/stalls and broad feature criteria remain open; no clean-case repeats or broad matrices.

Reference: installed Serato DJ Pro 4.0.10.213, with Desktop installers 4.0.9 and 4.0.10. Hardware reference: Hercules DJControl Inpulse 300 MK2. The latest recorded session used computer audio with that controller disconnected; no live device claim is made here. Ghidra is the selected deep-analysis tool; Hopper is a demo.

Findings distinguish observed behavior, file evidence, official documentation, inference, proposals and unknowns. Device enumeration and source inspection are not complete hardware compatibility. The original 74 proposed feature groups have expanded to 110; that count is not an assertion that the reference has exactly 110 features or that parity is verified.

Raw binaries, extracted slices, disassembly, private library data, screenshots and vendor article bodies stay outside Git under ignored `local-evidence/`. The repository contains original plans/findings, public-source metadata, diagnostic tooling, original browser prototype code and screenshots of that prototype.
