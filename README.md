# Open Play

## Current core delivery — 27 October 2026

**Private 0.1.79 / source `f9e7511` is inspected 5/5, current and observed paused.** Empty Recording preflight → normal 0.1.78 quit/process absence → closed 256-file / 120,336,037-byte hash-matched profile backup → exact 0.1.79 startup. Constant Change / Prism restored at 13.073 / 12.426 seconds, with 16 library tracks, two Play/tempo controls, six EQ controls and 12 AX library previews. Prior B LOW −24 dB restored; tempo/Sync reset normally. No main Play, Sync or REC Start. [Native evidence](docs/prototype/DESKTOP_CORE_079_2026-10-27.md).

CORE-FIX-32 Double completion retention is included alongside inherited loop/switch/analysis/load/Sync repairs and the flat-black palette. Its actual muted browser retention improves 114/355 → 355/355 controls, with 3/3 previews and outgoing voice/rate retained; focused checks 2/2. Focus/native held/playing/listening acceptance remains unverified. No new runtime module; legacy oversized app.js remains debt.

Launchers target 0.1.79; verified inactive 0.1.78 was removed, freeing 601,313,280 allocated bytes. Only 0.1.79 remains; build stage/tar are absent. Original audio, recordings and recovery backups are preserved. No Downloads clutter or broad test/soak/listening rerun.

Trello 180 cards / 14 complete. CORE-FIX-32 and broader criteria remain open. Prior 0.1.53 ordinary manual/jog/EQ/Cue/stop listening retains its scope. [CORE-LIVE-01](https://trello.com/c/yJ8r9kCD) holds deferred owner/controller/headphone/master/held/listening checks. Continue reproduced software-only core blockers; capture the next actual pop/stall before changing clocks/DSP. No public-beta/full-parity completion claim.

Independent open-source desktop DJ project, with a browser review candidate and ongoing reference investigation. The goal is familiar Serato DJ Pro design and behavior without artificial feature, account or device gates in the independent implementation.

## Historical implementation evidence

**Prior source candidates — core reliability:** Desktop0.1.56/source3667d6f saves Prepare/manual History edits in a focused39-line session-panels module.

Rare Sync pops/stalls and broad feature criteria remain open; no clean-case repeats or broad matrices.

Reference: installed Serato DJ Pro 4.0.10.213, with Desktop installers 4.0.9 and 4.0.10. Hardware reference: Hercules DJControl Inpulse 300 MK2. The latest recorded session used computer audio with that controller disconnected; no live device claim is made here. Ghidra is the selected deep-analysis tool; Hopper is a demo.

Findings distinguish observed behavior, file evidence, official documentation, inference, proposals and unknowns. Device enumeration and source inspection are not complete hardware compatibility. The original 74 proposed feature groups have expanded to 110; that count is not an assertion that the reference has exactly 110 features or that parity is verified.

Raw binaries, extracted slices, disassembly, private library data, screenshots and vendor article bodies stay outside Git under ignored `local-evidence/`. The repository contains original plans/findings, public-source metadata, diagnostic tooling, original browser prototype code and screenshots of that prototype.
